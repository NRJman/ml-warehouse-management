# Mock Warehouse Management System powered by Machine Learning Techniques

An app that allows to register as an admin, sign up subordinates, create a mock warehouse and manage items on it. There are two key features here.

Unlike the approaches introduced in the existing systems, the system proposes to use a machine learning technique at the stage of a new product registration. It is enough for a user to enter only the name and the manufacturer, so the program could attempt to predict its category by selecting one of already registered in the warehouse using the prepared cloud-based prediction model.

In addition, text IDs and computer vision services are also presented here as a replacement for barcodes and reading terminals (the last ones are supposed to be replaced by simple cellphones with a camera module). An employee only needs to take a picture of the relevant ID for the application to recognize the marking text in the background and download appropriate information about the requested product. Hence, it and suggests possible inventory processes can be applied to the item.
